Hypercardifies your site using css and webfont.

== Description ==

Hypercardinates your site using css and webfont - thanks to Giles Booth for releasing the Chicago-like webfont ChiKareGo via a Creative Commons license at [http://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/gallery/?id=3778](http://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/gallery/?id=3778)

The plugin also tries to force images to render in Hypercardesque high-contrast black and white (but some images sneak through - namely thumbnails for embedded videos etc.)

It should work with any theme.


== Installation ==

1. In your site's Dashboard > Plugins > Add New area, search for "Hypercardinator".
2. Click "Install"
3. Click "Activate"
4. There is no step 4

== Screenshots ==
